Datasets

Developing and testing novel intelligent approaches for the automatic detection and diagnosis of faults would be practically impossible without the availability of reliable datasets serving as
a foundation for such studies.
Many researchers dedicated their efforts collecting, building and making available online large datasets that could serve as a benchmark for their own studies, as well to studies
from other researchers.

Normally, these datasets are developed under laboratory conditions using test setups purposely built for fixed conditions and to reproduce a particular type of fault.

In other cases, commercially available simulators, built to simulate and study different kinds of machinery faults, are employed.
