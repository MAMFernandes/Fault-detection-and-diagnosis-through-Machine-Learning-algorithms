Developing and testing novel intelligent approaches for the detection and diagnosis of faults in rotating machinery would be practically impossible without the availability of reliable datasets serving as a foundation for such studies. Many researchers dedicated their efforts collecting, building and making available online large datasets that could serve as a benchmark for their own studies, as well to studies
from other researchers.
